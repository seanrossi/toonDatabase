<h1> This is Sean's Heading </h1>
<p> This is Sean's first paragraphh. Sean is learning how to build a webpage from the ground up. He is starting by bushing up on html and soon moving onto javscript, before diving into php and mysql. The ultimate goal for the moment is to build his own cartoon database detailing the Golden Age of animation, such as MGM, Warner Bros and Disney. </p>


<p>This is a second paragraph. This paragraph doesn't contain additional information, its purpose is just to test the paragraph tag.</p>
